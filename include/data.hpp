// The goal of this file, is to provide a set of functions that can be used to put in graphs the aerodynamic forces acting on a car.
// The namespace should cover the following topics:
//  - Drag force
//  - Aerodynamic drag coefficient
//  - Lift force
//  - Lift coefficient
//  - Lateral lift coefficient
//  - Rolling resistance

// The data should be provided in the following format:
//  - Speeds: a vector of speeds in m/s
//  - Density: the air density in kg/m^3
//  - Reference area: the reference area in m^2
//  - Coefficient : No unit
//  - Force: the force in N

// The data should be represented in .xlsx files, with the following columns:
