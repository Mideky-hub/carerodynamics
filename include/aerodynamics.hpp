// Applied Aerodynamics for Cars
// We can separate the properties of aerodynamics into two main categories: drag and lift.
//
// Drag is the force that opposes the motion of the car, and lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.
// The drag force is the sum of the aerodynamic drag force and the rolling resistance.
//      Rolling resistance is the force that opposes the motion of the car due to the deformation of the tires and the road surface.
// The lift force is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion.
